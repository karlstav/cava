[general]

# 'autosens' will attempt to decrease sensitivity if the bars peak. 1 = on, 0 = off
# new as of 0.6.0 autosens of low values (dynamic range)
# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.

# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.

# increasing the will improve the accuracy of the visualization,
# but will also make it slower and increase CPU usage
# anything below 10 and above 13 is considered experimental.

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa', 'fifo', 'sndio' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
# For shmem 'source' will be /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF where 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' will be squeezelite's MAC address

[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses' or 'raw'.
# 'noncurses' uses a custom framebuffer technique and draws only changes
# from frame to frame. As of version 0.7.0 'noncurses' is default.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
; method = ncurses

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
; channels = stereo

# Raw output target. A fifo will be created if target does not exist.

# Ascii max value. In 'ascii' mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# Use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)).

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.

# ncurses output method and a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# default is to keep current terminal color

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors (and thereby ncurses mode) are supported,

[smoothing]

# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.

# Disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing" with or without "waves". Set to 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 0

# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 100


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
