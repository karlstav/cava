[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are: 'fifo', 'portaudio', 'pipewire', 'alsa', 'pulse', 'sndio', 'oss', 'jack' or 'shmem'
# Defaults to 'oss', 'pipewire', 'sndio', 'jack', 'pulse', 'alsa', 'portaudio' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with.
# On Mac it defaults to 'portaudio' or 'fifo'
# On windows this is automatic and no input settings are needed.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio and pipewire 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For pipewire 'source' will be the object name or object.serial of the device to capture from.
# Both input and output devices are supported. To capture the monitor source of a sink node, append '.monitor' to the sink's object name.
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
# For shmem 'source' will be /squeezelite-AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF where 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' will be squeezelite's MAC address
#
# For sndio 'source' will be a raw recording audio descriptor or a monitoring sub-device, e.g. 'rsnd/2' or 'snd/1'. Default: 'default'.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for sndio.
#
# For oss 'source' will be the path to a audio device, e.g. '/dev/dsp2'. Default: '/dev/dsp', i.e. the default audio device.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for OSS on FreeBSD.
#
# For jack 'source' will be the name of the JACK server to connect to, e.g. 'foobar'. Default: 'default'.
# README.md contains further information on how to setup CAVA for JACK.

#   channels:    sndio, oss, jack
#   autoconnect: jack
# Other methods ignore these settings.
# For pipewire, sample_rate will default to 48000, for all other input methods, sample_rate will default to 44100.
#
# For 'sndio' and 'oss' they are only preferred values, i.e. if the values are not supported
# by the chosen audio device, the device will use other supported values instead.
# Example: 48000, 32 and 2, but the device only supports 44100, 16 and 1, then it
# will use 44100, 16 and 1.
#
#
# The 'pipewire' input method has three options to control linking and mixing:
#   active: Force the node to always process. Useful for monitoring sources when no other application is active.
#   remix: Allow pipewire to remix audio channels to match cava's channel count. Useful for surround sound.
#   virtual: Set the node to virtual, to avoid recording notifications from the DE.

[output]

# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses', 'raw', 'noritake', 'sdl'
# or 'sdl_glsl'.
# 'noncurses' (default) uses a buffer and cursor movements to only print
# changes from frame to frame in the terminal. Uses less resources and is less
# prone to tearing (vsync issues) than 'ncurses'.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 1024 bars stereo (512 bars mono), which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
#
# 'noritake' outputs a bitmap in the format expected by a Noritake VFD display
#  in graphic mode. It only support the 3000 series graphical VFDs for now.
#
# 'sdl' uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer to render in a graphical context.
# 'sdl_glsl' uses SDL to create an OpenGL context. Write your own shaders or
# use one of the predefined ones.
; method = noncurses

# Orientation of the visualization. Can be 'bottom', 'top', 'left', 'right' or
# 'horizontal'. Default is 'bottom'. 'left and 'right' are only supported on sdl
# and ncruses output. 'horizontal' (bars go up and down from center) is only supported
# on noncurses output.
# Note: many fonts have weird or missing glyphs for characters used in orientations
# other than 'bottom', which can make output not look right.
; orientation = bottom

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
# set 'reverse' to 1 to display frequencies the other way around.

[smoothing]

; gravity = 100


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
