You will need the following dlls:
* fftw3.dll
* glew.dll
* libpthread.dll
* SDL2.dll

(should be added in the .zip bin package when/if I make one)

Install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 (maybe also a newer one) was needed when I first ran it. Not sure why we need that old one.

copy the config file and the shaders folder to `C:\Users\"username"\.config\cava`
